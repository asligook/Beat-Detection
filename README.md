The project aims to find the BPM of given stereo files with 2 different beat detection algorithms. 
For this project, we assumed that stereo files contain single BPM.
List of song information:
- sevdacicegi.wav sample rate 44100 Hz, stereo, 114.5 BPM 
- dudu.wav sample rate 44100 Hz, stereo, 91.0 BPM
- beat.wav sample rate 44100 Hz, stereo, 60.0 BPM
- aleph.wav sample rate 44100 Hz, stereo, 81.0 BPM

Run:
- The execution of project can be done via Matlab.
- Make sure that .wav files and .m files are placed under the same folder and run the code, the results will be shown as printed to the Matlab console.
